## Overview

Worten, the leading electronics retailer in the Iberian Peninsula, chose Div Tecnologia to develop their main digital applications. The challenge was to create a robust technological infrastructure that would support e-commerce and marketplace operations in Portugal and Spain.

Our work began with the development of the new e-commerce platform, followed by the creation of a custom CMS for content management and a specialized CRM to manage marketplace sellers. These solutions allowed Worten to expand their digital business model, including third-party sellers while maintaining full control over the operation.

The project resulted in a scalable, high-performance digital platform, enabling Worten to efficiently and securely serve millions of online customers.
