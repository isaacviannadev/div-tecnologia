## Overview
<br/>
After developing an innovative elderly care model, **zeloclub** approached us to create a platform that would safely and efficiently connect families with professional caregivers.
<br/>
The platform needed to solve two main challenges:
- Ensure caregiver quality and reliability through rigorous background checks and real-time rating system
- Provide smooth scheduling and payment experience with intelligent matching based on location, experience, and availability
<br/>

We implemented a robust administrative dashboard to monitor satisfaction and performance, plus an optimized algorithm that considers multiple factors to find the ideal caregiver for each family.
<br/>

   Working with <em>DIV</em> was like having a true partner, not just a vendor. 
   They understood our mission to transform elderly care into something more human and professional, 
   bringing peace of mind to Brazilian families.
